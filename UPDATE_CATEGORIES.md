# Category Update for Marsa FYI Platform

## Overview
This update replaces the original 8 basic categories with the full 39 categories used in the ShopPage to ensure consistency across the platform.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Created `update_categories.sql` script to replace existing categories with the full 39 categories
   - The new categories match exactly with those used in the ShopPage component

2. **Server Code Update**:
   - Modified the product creation endpoint in `server.js` to work with the predefined categories
   - Removed the dynamic category creation logic since all categories are now predefined

3. **Frontend Consistency**:
   - The SellerDashboard was already using the correct 39 categories
   - No changes needed to the frontend components

## Implementation Steps

1. **Apply Database Update**:
   Run the `update_categories.sql` script against your database to update the categories table:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the update_categories.sql script
   ```

2. **Verify Categories**:
   After running the script, verify that all 39 categories are present in the categories table:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name FROM categories ORDER BY id;
   ```

3. **Test Product Creation**:
