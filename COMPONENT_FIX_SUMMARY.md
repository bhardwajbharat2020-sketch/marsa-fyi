# Component Fix Summary

This document explains the changes made to fix the Login and Register components.

## Issues Identified

1. The Login and Register components were modified to use Supabase authentication directly
2. This caused issues with the application flow and appearance
3. The components were not following the original script flow

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Reverted Login Component**:
   - Removed Supabase authentication integration
   - Restored to mock login functionality
   - Maintained the original UI/UX design
   - Kept the same form structure and styling

2. **Reverted Register Component**:
   - Removed Supabase authentication integration
   - Restored to mock registration functionality
   - Maintained the password confirmation field (as requested)
   - Added workClass selection dropdown
   - Kept the same form structure and styling
   - Maintained role-based redirection through AuthContext

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/Login.js` - Reverted to mock authentication
2. `client/src/components/Register.js` - Reverted to mock registration with password confirmation

## Component Behavior

### Login Component
- Uses mock authentication instead of Supabase
- Simulates successful login with mock user data
- Redirects to role-specific dashboard based on mock role

### Register Component
- Uses mock registration instead of Supabase
- Includes password confirmation field (as requested)
- Includes workClass selection dropdown
- Generates mock vendor code based on selected role
- Redirects to role-specific dashboard based on selected role

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Start the client application: `npm start`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register
3. Fill out the registration form with:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Username
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Work Class (select from dropdown)
   - Password
   - Confirm Password (must match password)
4. Submit the form
5. Verify redirection to role-specific dashboard
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
7. Enter any email and password
8. Verify redirection to seller dashboard (mock role)

## Future Considerations

- When Supabase integration is properly implemented, these components can be updated
- Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures
- Implement actual API calls to backend for authentication
