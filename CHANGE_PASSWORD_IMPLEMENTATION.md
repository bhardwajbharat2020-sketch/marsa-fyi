# Change Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the change password feature for all dashboards in the MarsaFyi application. Users can now change their password directly from any dashboard without using the forgot password flow.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Endpoint (server.js)

#### Change Password Endpoint (`/api/auth/change-password`)
- **Method**: PUT
- **Authentication**: Required (uses existing authenticateToken middleware)
- **Parameters**:
  - `currentPassword` (string): User's current password
  - `newPassword` (string): User's desired new password

- **Features**:
  - Validates that both current and new passwords are provided
  - Verifies current password is correct using bcrypt comparison
  - Validates new password strength (8+ chars, uppercase, number, special char)
  - Ensures new password is different from current password
  - Hashes and updates the new password in the database
  - Returns appropriate success or error messages

### 2. Frontend Components

#### ChangePasswordModal Component
- Reusable modal component that can be used in any dashboard
- Form with three fields:
  - Current Password (password type)
  - New Password (password type)
  - Confirm New Password (password type)
- Real-time password validation
- Loading states during API requests
- Success and error messaging
- Responsive design matching the application theme

#### DashboardLayout Updates
- Added "Change Password" option to all dashboard sidebars
- Added "Change Password" button to the top navigation bar
- Integrated ChangePasswordModal component
- Added state management for modal visibility

## Security Features

1. **Password Verification**: Users must provide their current password to change it
2. **Password Strength**: New passwords must meet security requirements
3. **Password Comparison**: New password must be different from current password
4. **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated users can change their password
5. **Secure Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Change Password" in dashboard sidebar or top navigation
2. Change Password modal appears
3. User enters current password
4. User enters and confirms new password
5. System validates passwords
6. If valid, system updates password in database
7. User receives success confirmation

## Files Modified/Added

1. `server/server.js` - Added change password endpoint
2. `client/src/components/DashboardLayout.js` - Added change password option to all dashboards
3. `client/src/components/ChangePasswordModal.js` - New component for change password modal

## How to Test

1. Start the server: `npm start` in the server directory
2. Start the client: `npm start` in the client directory
3. Log in to any dashboard
4. Click "Change Password" in the sidebar or top navigation
5. Enter current password and new password
6. Verify password is changed successfully

## API Endpoint Details

### Change Password
```
PUT /api/auth/change-password
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "currentPassword": "user_current_password",
  "newPassword": "user_new_password"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password has been changed successfully."
}
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Current password and new password are required"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Current password is incorrect"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "New password does not meet requirements: [list of requirements]"
}
```

## Integration with Existing Features

The change password feature works alongside the existing forgot password feature:
- **Forgot Password**: For users who don't remember their current password
- **Change Password**: For users who remember their current password and want to update it

Both features use the same password validation rules and security practices.
