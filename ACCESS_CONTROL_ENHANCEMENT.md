# Access Control Enhancement

## Issue
Previously, when users tried to access dashboards for roles they didn't have, they were redirected to their own dashboard. This didn't clearly communicate that they were attempting to access a restricted area.

## Solution
Enhanced the access control system to show a clear "Access Denied" message when users try to access dashboards for roles they don't have permission for.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created AccessDenied Component
A new `AccessDenied` component was created that:
- Clearly informs users they don't have permission to view the requested dashboard
- Shows the user's current role for clarity
- Provides buttons to navigate to their own dashboard or the home page
- Uses the same styling as other components in the application

### 2. Updated ProtectedRoute Component
Modified the `ProtectedRoute` component to:
- Show the `AccessDenied` page instead of redirecting unauthorized users
- Maintain the existing authentication and role checking logic
- Provide a better user experience by clearly explaining why access is denied

### 3. Updated App.js Routing
Added the new `AccessDenied` route to the application routing.

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in and their role is stored in the AuthContext
2. When user tries to access a dashboard route, ProtectedRoute checks their role
3. If role matches allowed roles for that route → Grant access to the dashboard
4. If role doesn't match → Show AccessDenied page instead of redirecting

### User Experience
When a seller tries to access the HR dashboard (`/dashboard/hr`):
1. They see a clear "Access Denied" message
2. The message explains they don't have permission to view this dashboard
3. It shows their current role (seller)
4. They can choose to go to their own dashboard or back to the home page

## Files Modified/Created

1. `client/src/components/AccessDenied.js` - New component for access denied page
2. `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.js` - Updated to show AccessDenied page
3. `client/src/App.js` - Added AccessDenied route

## Testing

To test the enhanced access control:
1. Log in as a seller
2. Try to access `/dashboard/hr` - You should see the AccessDenied page
3. Click "Go to My Dashboard" - You should be taken to `/dashboard/seller`
4. Click "Back to Home" - You should be taken to the main dashboard

## Benefits

1. **Clear Communication**: Users understand why they can't access certain areas
2. **Better UX**: Provides clear navigation options instead of automatic redirects
3. **Security Awareness**: Helps users understand the role-based access system
4. **Consistent Design**: Uses the same styling as other application components
