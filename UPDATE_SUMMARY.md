# MARSa FYI Project Update Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to update your project with the new Supabase credentials and enhance the role-based dashboard functionality.

## Updated Supabase Credentials

The following files have been updated with your new Supabase project credentials:

1. **Root `.env` file**:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: https://yuphowxgoxienbnwcgra.supabase.co
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Service role key (updated)

2. **Server `.env` file**:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: https://yuphowxgoxienbnwcgra.supabase.co
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Service role key (updated)

3. **Client `.env` file** (newly created):
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`: https://yuphowxgoxienbnwcgra.supabase.co
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Anon key (new)

## New Client-Side Supabase Integration

1. **Supabase Client Configuration** (`client/src/supabaseClient.js`):
   - Created a new Supabase client configuration file
   - Uses environment variables for credentials
   - Falls back to your project credentials if environment variables are not set

2. **Package.json Update** (`client/package.json`):
   - Added `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency

## Enhanced Role-Based Dashboard Functionality

1. **AuthContext Enhancement** (`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`):
   - Added automatic redirection to role-specific dashboards after login
   - Added role switching functionality that redirects to the appropriate dashboard
   - Integrated with React Router's useNavigate hook

2. **Role Dashboard Component** (`client/src/components/RoleDashboard.js`):
   - Created a component that automatically redirects users to their role-specific dashboard
   - Implements the project specification requirement for role-based routing

3. **Role-Specific Dashboard Components**:
   - Created AdminDashboard component
   - Created SellerDashboard component
   - Created BuyerDashboard component
   - Updated App.js to include routes for all dashboards

4. **Authentication Components**:
   - Enhanced Login component to use Supabase authentication
   - Enhanced Register component to create users in both Supabase Auth and the database

## Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation files to use your new project URL in examples:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `COMPREHENSIVE_SCHEMA_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md`

## How to Use the Updated Project

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - The root and server `.env` files are already configured with your Supabase credentials
   - The client `.env` file is configured with your Supabase credentials for frontend use

2. **Client-Side Usage**:
   - Import the Supabase client from `./src/supabaseClient.js`
   - Use the AuthContext for authentication and role-based routing
   - Access role-specific dashboards through the defined routes

3. **Server-Side Usage**:
   - The server will automatically use the credentials from the `.env` file
   - Supabase client is initialized in `server.js`

## Role-Based Dashboard Routing

The project now fully implements the role-based dashboard routing requirement:
- After login, users are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard
- Users can switch roles and will be redirected to the appropriate dashboard
- Each role has its own dedicated dashboard component

## Testing the Updates

1. Make sure all environment files are properly configured
2. Install dependencies in both client and server directories:
   ```
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```
3. Start the development servers:
   ```
   # In one terminal
   cd server && npm start
   
   # In another terminal
   cd client && npm start
   ```
4. Test the authentication flow:
   - Register a new user
   - Login with the new user
   - Verify redirection to the appropriate dashboard
   - Test role switching functionality

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated client and server applications
2. Test all role-specific dashboards
3. Implement additional role-specific functionality as needed
4. Add more comprehensive error handling and user feedback
