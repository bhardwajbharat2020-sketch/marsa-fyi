# Dashboard Access Control Security Fix

## Issue
Previously, any user could access any dashboard by simply changing the URL in the browser's address bar. For example, a buyer could access the seller dashboard by navigating to `/dashboard/seller`, which is a serious security vulnerability.

## Solution
Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access dashboards that match their assigned role.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created ProtectedRoute Component
A new `ProtectedRoute` component was created that:
- Checks if the user is authenticated
- Verifies if the user's role is in the list of allowed roles for a specific route
- Redirects unauthorized users to their own dashboard
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page

### 2. Updated App.js Routing
Modified the routing configuration in `App.js` to wrap all dashboard routes with the `ProtectedRoute` component, specifying which roles are allowed to access each dashboard:

```jsx
<Route 
  path="/dashboard/seller" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['seller']}>
      <SellerDashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

### 3. Role Validation Logic
The `ProtectedRoute` component implements the following logic:
1. If user is not logged in → Redirect to login page
2. If user role is not set → Redirect to role selection page
3. If user's role is in allowed roles → Allow access to the dashboard
4. If user's role is not in allowed roles → Redirect to user's own dashboard

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in and their role is stored in the AuthContext
2. When user tries to access a dashboard route, ProtectedRoute checks their role
3. If role matches allowed roles for that route → Grant access
4. If role doesn't match → Redirect to user's own dashboard

### Example Scenarios
1. **Seller accessing seller dashboard** (`/dashboard/seller`) → ALLOWED
2. **Buyer trying to access seller dashboard** (`/dashboard/seller`) → DENIED, redirected to buyer dashboard
3. **Unauthenticated user accessing any dashboard** → DENIED, redirected to login page

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.js` - New component for role-based access control
2. `client/src/App.js` - Updated routing to use ProtectedRoute for all dashboard routes

## Testing

To test the security fix:
1. Log in as a seller
2. Try to access `/dashboard/buyer` - You should be redirected back to `/dashboard/seller`
3. Log out and try to access any dashboard - You should be redirected to `/login`
4. Log in as a buyer and try to access `/dashboard/seller` - You should be redirected back to `/dashboard/buyer`

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Unauthorized Access**: Users cannot access dashboards for roles they don't have
2. **Maintains Data Privacy**: Sensitive information in role-specific dashboards is protected
3. **Compliance**: Ensures users only access functionality appropriate to their role
4. **Audit Trail**: Unauthorized access attempts can be logged for security monitoring
