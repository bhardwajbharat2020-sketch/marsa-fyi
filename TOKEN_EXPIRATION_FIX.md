# Token Expiration Issue Fix

## Problem
Users are seeing "Invalid or expired token" when trying to change their password. This happens because JWT tokens have a limited lifespan (24 hours in this application) and expire after that time.

## Root Causes

1. **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens are set to expire after 24 hours for security reasons
2. **No Automatic Refresh**: The application doesn't have an automatic token refresh mechanism
3. **No Expiration Check**: The frontend wasn't checking if the token was still valid before making requests

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Token Retrieval
- Updated [ChangePasswordModal.js](file:///c:\Users\bhard\OneDrive\Desktop\marsa-fyi\client\src\components\ChangePasswordModal.js) to use the `authToken` from AuthContext instead of localStorage
- This ensures the most current token is used

### 2. Added Token Validation
- Enhanced [AuthContext.js](file:///c:\Users\bhard\OneDrive\Desktop\marsa-fyi\client\src\contexts\AuthContext.js) with `isTokenValid()` function to check token expiration
- Added automatic redirect to login when token expires

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Updated [ChangePasswordModal.js](file:///c:\Users\bhard\OneDrive\Desktop\marsa-fyi\client\src\components\ChangePasswordModal.js) to handle token expiration errors gracefully
- Added user-friendly error messages when token expires
- Implemented automatic redirect to login page after token expiration

## How It Works Now

1. When user opens the Change Password modal, the app checks if the token is still valid
2. If token is expired, user sees a message: "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
3. User is automatically redirected to the login page after 2 seconds
4. If token is valid, the password change request is made with the proper authentication header

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Added token validation functions
2. `client/src/components/ChangePasswordModal.js` - Fixed token usage and added expiration handling

## Testing the Fix

1. Log in to the application
2. Wait for 24 hours (or simulate token expiration)
3. Try to change password
4. You should see the expiration message and be redirected to login

## Prevention for Future

### For Users:
- Log out and log back in periodically to refresh your token
- If you see "Invalid or expired token" messages, simply log out and log back in

### For Developers:
- Consider implementing a token refresh endpoint in the future
- Add automatic token refresh before expiration
- Implement persistent login sessions

## Token Details

- **Expiration Time**: 24 hours from login
- **Storage**: localStorage as `marsafyi_token`
- **Format**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Validation**: Checked before sensitive operations

## Manual Token Testing

To manually test a token:

1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Application/Storage tab
4. Find localStorage item `marsafyi_token`
5. Copy the token value
6. Set environment variable: `TEST_AUTH_TOKEN="your-copied-token"`
7. Run: `node test_token.js`

This will show if your token is valid and when it expires.
