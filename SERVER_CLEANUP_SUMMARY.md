# Server Cleanup Summary

This document explains the changes made to resolve the server file confusion and ensure a clean, functional server setup.

## Issue Identified

The server directory contained two identical large JavaScript files:
- `server.js` (configured as main file in package.json)
- `clean_server.js` (redundant duplicate)

This duplication was causing confusion about which file to run and was unnecessary.

## Actions Taken

1. **Removed Redundant File**:
   - Deleted `clean_server.js` as it was identical to `server.js`
   - Kept `server.js` as it's configured as the main file in package.json

2. **Verified Configuration**:
   - Confirmed that package.json correctly points to `server.js` as the main file
   - Verified that start scripts use `server.js`

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - Added README.md files to both client and server directories
   - Updated main README.md to reflect current project structure
   - Documented Supabase integration in main README.md

## Current Server Structure

```
server/
├── server.js          # Main server file (entry point)
├── package.json       # Dependencies and scripts configuration
├── .env               # Environment variables
├── README.md          # Server documentation
└── test-env.js        # Environment testing utility
```

## How to Run the Server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env` file

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables Required

- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key
- `PORT` - Server port (defaults to 5000)

## Integration with Client

The server is designed to work with the React client:
- Serves API endpoints for user registration, login, etc.
- Integrates with Supabase for database operations
- Can serve the built React app in production

## Supabase Integration

The server uses Supabase for:
- Database operations
- User authentication (in conjunction with client-side Supabase Auth)
- Real-time data synchronization

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Supabase credentials are valid
3. Check that all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Ensure you're running the correct file:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

## Future Maintenance

To avoid similar issues in the future:
- Only maintain one main server file
- Keep documentation up to date
- Regularly review and clean up unnecessary files
- Ensure package.json correctly points to the main file
