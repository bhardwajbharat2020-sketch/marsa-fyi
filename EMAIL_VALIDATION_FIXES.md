# Email Validation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Email Format Validation**: The registration form was not validating that emails contain "@" with content after it.

2. **Late Validation**: Email validation was only happening at submission instead of providing real-time feedback.

3. **Always Visible Validation**: The request was to show validation errors only when the format is incorrect, not all the time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Real-time Email Validation (Register.js)
- Added `emailError` state to track email validation issues
- Added `validateEmailFormat` function to check email format as user types
- Added `handleInputChange` logic to trigger email validation on email changes

### 2. Updated Email Input Display (Register.js)
- Added conditional display of email validation error message
- Error message only shows when email format is invalid
- Error message disappears when email format is corrected

### 3. Updated Validation Logic (Register.js)
- Modified both `handleSubmit` and `handleNextStep1` functions to check email validation
- Ensured validation happens immediately when user tries to proceed to step 2

## Validation Requirements Implemented

The email must:
- Contain "@" character
- Have content both before and after the "@" character

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see validation status as they type
2. **Conditional Display**: Error messages only appear when there's actually an error
3. **Clear Requirements**: Users understand exactly what format is required
4. **Prevention of Errors**: Users can't proceed to step 2 with an invalid email format

## Technical Implementation

### Email Validation Regex
```javascript
const emailRegex = /^[^@]+@.+$/;
```

This regex ensures:
- `[^@]+` - One or more characters that are not "@" (before the @)
- `@` - Exactly one "@" character
- `.+` - One or more characters (after the @)

### State Management
- `emailError` state tracks validation status
- Error message is displayed only when `emailError` is not empty
- Error message is cleared when email format is corrected

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Enter an email without "@" - no error should show initially
3. Enter an email like "test" - error should show "Email must contain @ with content after it"
4. Enter an email like "test@" - error should show (missing content after @)
5. Enter an email like "test@example.com" - error should disappear
6. Try to proceed to step 2 with an invalid email - should be blocked with error message

The validation now works in real-time and only shows errors when the format is actually incorrect, providing a better user experience.
