# Revert Summary

## Actions Taken

1. **Reverted vercel.json** to original configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "server/server.js",
         "use": "@vercel/node"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "server/server.js"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Restored server.js** from backup (server.js.backup)

3. **Removed test files** created during troubleshooting:
   - test-js-serving.js
   - test-css-serving.js
   - vercel-deployment-test.js
   - test-static-files.js
   - test-supabase-connection.js
   - test-frontend-build.js
   - test-api-endpoints.js

4. **Removed documentation files** created during troubleshooting:
   - FIX_SUMMARY.md
   - VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md
   - FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md
   - VERCEL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   - FIXES_SUMMARY.md

## Current State

The project is now back to its original state before my attempted fixes. The vercel.json and server.js files are restored to their original configurations.

## Next Steps

Since the original configuration was causing issues, we need to identify the root cause of the Vercel deployment problems without making changes that create more issues.

The main issues were:
1. "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'" - JavaScript files being served as HTML
2. 404 errors for static assets (CSS, JS, manifest.json, favicon.ico)

These issues suggest that the static file serving configuration needs to be addressed, but in a way that doesn't break the existing functionality.
