# Summary of Fixes for "Failed to fetch catalogs" Error

## Problem
The "Failed to fetch catalogs" error was occurring during Vercel app build/deployment due to:
1. Improper environment variable configuration in Vercel
2. Lack of detailed error logging in the API endpoints
3. Missing Vercel configuration file

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed console logging to both `/api/catalogs` and `/api/products` endpoints
- Added error details and stack traces for better debugging
- Added logging for Supabase connection status and data fetching

### 2. Fixed Environment Variable Loading
- Updated server.js to properly load .env file from the correct path
- Added logging to verify Supabase credentials are loaded correctly

### 3. Created Vercel Configuration
- Created vercel.json file with proper build configuration
- Configured environment variables for Vercel deployment

### 4. Added Health Check Endpoint
- Added `/api/health` endpoint to verify server status and Supabase connection

### 5. Created Deployment Documentation
- Created DEPLOYMENT.md with instructions for setting up Vercel environment variables

## Files Modified/Added

1. `server/server.js` - Enhanced error logging and fixed environment variable loading
2. `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
3. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions
4. `test-db-connection.js` - Database connection test script
5. `test-catalogs.js` - Catalogs endpoint test script
6. `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## How to Fix the Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add the following environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key

The vercel.json file will ensure these environment variables are properly passed to your application.

## Testing Locally

To test the API endpoints locally:

1. Run `npm install` in both the root directory and the client directory
2. Ensure your `.env` file in the root directory contains your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```
3. Run `npm start` in the root directory
4. Test the endpoints:
   - http://localhost:5000/api/catalogs
   - http://localhost:5000/api/products
   - http://localhost:5000/api/health

## Checking Logs in Vercel

To check for errors in Vercel:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on the "Logs" tab
4. Look for any error messages related to the API endpoints

The enhanced logging in the endpoints will provide detailed information about what's happening during the API calls.
