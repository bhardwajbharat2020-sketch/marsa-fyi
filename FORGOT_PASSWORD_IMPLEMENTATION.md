# Forgot Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the forgot password feature for the MarsaFyi application. The feature allows users to reset their password if they forget it by providing their email address.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Endpoints (server.js)

#### a. Forgot Password Endpoint (`/api/auth/forgot-password`)
- Accepts user's email address
- Validates email format
- Checks if user exists (without revealing if email exists for security)
- Generates a secure reset token
- Stores token in `password_reset_tokens` table with 1-hour expiration
- Returns success message (even if email doesn't exist for security)

#### b. Reset Password Endpoint (`/api/auth/reset-password`)
- Accepts reset token and new password
- Validates password strength requirements
- Verifies token exists and is valid
- Checks token expiration and usage status
- Updates user's password in the database
- Marks token as used

### 2. Frontend Components

#### a. Login Page Updates
- Added "Forgot Password?" button/link
- Implemented forgot password form with email input
- Added state management for forgot password flow
- Integrated with backend forgot password endpoint

#### b. New Reset Password Page (`ResetPassword.js`)
- Dedicated page for password reset (`/reset-password`)
- Form with new password and confirm password fields
- Password strength validation
- Token extraction from URL parameters
- Integration with backend reset password endpoint

### 3. Database Schema
The application already had a `password_reset_tokens` table in the schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token TEXT NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Security Features

1. **Email Enumeration Prevention**: The forgot password endpoint returns the same response whether the email exists or not
2. **Secure Token Generation**: Uses crypto library to generate secure random tokens
3. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour
4. **One-Time Use**: Tokens are marked as used after successful password reset
5. **Password Requirements**: New passwords must meet strength requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, number, special character)

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. User enters email address in forgot password form
3. System sends password reset instructions (in development - currently logs to console)
4. User receives reset link (in email in production)
5. User clicks link which opens reset password page with token
6. User enters and confirms new password
7. System validates and updates password
8. User can log in with new password

## Files Modified/Added

1. `server/server.js` - Added forgot password and reset password endpoints
2. `client/src/components/Login.js` - Added forgot password functionality
3. `client/src/components/ResetPassword.js` - New component for reset password page
4. `client/src/App.js` - Added route for reset password page

## Future Improvements

1. **Email Integration**: Implement actual email sending using a service like SendGrid or Nodemailer
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the forgot password endpoint
3. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Add better error handling and user feedback
4. **Token Encryption**: Encrypt tokens at rest for additional security
