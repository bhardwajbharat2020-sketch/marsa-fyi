# Seller Dashboard Enhancements

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the Seller Dashboard product creation form to improve the user experience and ensure proper terms acceptance.

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Category Dropdown
Replaced the text input for category with a dropdown selection:
- Added a comprehensive list of 39 categories from the ShopPage
- Users can now select from predefined categories instead of typing
- Ensures consistency in category naming across the platform
- Prevents creation of duplicate or misspelled categories

### 2. Additional Terms and Conditions Checkboxes
Added two new checkboxes for terms acceptance:
- **Seller Agreement**: A required checkbox for accepting the seller agreement
- **Re-labeling Terms**: A conditional checkbox that only appears when re-labeling is selected

### 3. Conditional Re-labeling Terms
Implemented conditional logic for the re-labeling terms:
- The re-labeling terms checkbox only appears when the user selects "Yes" for re-labeling
- If re-labeling is selected, the re-labeling terms become required
- If re-labeling is not selected, the re-labeling terms checkbox is hidden

### 4. Enhanced Validation
Improved form validation to ensure all required terms are accepted:
- Validates that both survey terms and seller agreement are accepted
- If re-labeling is selected, also validates that re-labeling terms are accepted
- Provides clear error messages for missing required fields

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
1. **Category Selection**:
   - Replaced `<input type="text">` with `<select>` dropdown

### User Experience Improvements
