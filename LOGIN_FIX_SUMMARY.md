# Login and Role Routing Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Login Endpoint**: The server was missing the `/api/auth/login` endpoint that the client was trying to call.
2. **Role Code Mismatch**: The client-side code was checking for role codes (e.g., 'SELL', 'BUY') instead of full role names (e.g., 'seller', 'buyer').
3. **Inconsistent Role Handling**: The AuthContext and Login component were expecting full role names, but the RoleDashboard was checking for role codes.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Login Endpoint to Server
- Created a new `/api/auth/login` endpoint in `server/server.js`
- The endpoint validates user credentials against the database
- It fetches the user's primary role from the user_roles and roles tables
- Returns the user data along with their role name (not code)

### 2. Fixed RoleDashboard Component
- Updated `client/src/components/RoleDashboard.js` to check for full role names instead of codes
- Changed role checks from 'SELL', 'BUY', etc. to 'seller', 'buyer', etc.
- Added a default redirect to the buyer dashboard for unknown roles

### 3. Fixed Login Component
- Updated `client/src/components/Login.js` to check for full role names instead of codes
- Changed role checks in the redirect switch statement to use full role names
- Added a default redirect to the buyer dashboard for unknown roles

## How It Works Now

1. **User Registration**: When a user registers, they select a role (e.g., 'seller')
2. **Database Storage**: The role is stored in the `roles` table with both name ('seller') and code ('SELL')
3. **User Login**: When a user logs in:
   - Credentials are validated against the database
   - User's primary role is fetched from the user_roles and roles tables
   - The full role name (e.g., 'seller') is returned to the client
4. **Role Routing**: The client-side code now correctly:
   - Uses the full role name for routing decisions
   - Redirects sellers to `/dashboard/seller`
   - Redirects buyers to `/dashboard/buyer`
   - And so on for all other roles

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Register as a seller and note the vendor code
2. Log out
3. Log back in using the vendor code and password
4. You should be redirected to the seller dashboard (`/dashboard/seller`) instead of the buyer dashboard

## Files Modified

1. `server/server.js` - Added login endpoint
2. `client/src/components/RoleDashboard.js` - Fixed role checking
3. `client/src/components/Login.js` - Fixed role checking
