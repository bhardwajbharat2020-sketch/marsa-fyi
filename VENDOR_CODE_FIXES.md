# Vendor Code Display Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Undefined Vendor Code**: The dashboard was showing "Vendor Code: undefined" instead of the actual vendor code.

2. **Incorrect Property Access**: The frontend was trying to access `userData.vendorCode` but the server was returning `userData.vendor_code`.

3. **Label Confusion**: The display label was "Vendor Code" but the request was to show "Role Code".

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Property Name Access (AuthContext.js)
- Changed `userData.vendorCode` to `userData.vendor_code` in the login function
- Updated localStorage storage to use the correct property name
- Ensured consistent property access throughout the authentication context

### 2. Updated Display Label (DashboardLayout.js)
- Changed "Vendor Code" to "Role Code" in the dashboard display
- Maintained the same styling and positioning

### 3. Verified Server Response (server.js)
- Confirmed the server correctly returns `vendor_code` in the user object
- Verified the login endpoint response structure

## Technical Details

### Property Names
- Server response field: `vendor_code`
- Frontend access: `userData.vendor_code`
- LocalStorage key: `marsafyi_vendor_code`

### Display Format
The vendor code follows the format: `ROLE-YY-XXXXXX` where:
- ROLE: Role prefix (e.g., TRN for Transporter)
- YY: Last two digits of current year
- XXXXXX: Random 6-character alphanumeric code

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Correct Information Display**: Users now see their actual role code instead of "undefined"
2. **Clear Labeling**: The label "Role Code" is more descriptive than "Vendor Code"
3. **Consistent Data Flow**: Data is correctly passed from server to client storage to display

## Testing

To verify these fixes:
1. Register a new user (e.g., as Transporter)
2. Log in with the new credentials
3. Check that the dashboard shows "Role Code: TRN-25-XXXXXX" (or appropriate code)
4. Verify the role code matches the expected format
5. Confirm the user's name is displayed correctly

## Additional Notes

The fixes ensure that:
- Role codes are properly stored in localStorage on login
- Role codes are correctly retrieved from localStorage on page refresh
- The display shows the actual role code instead of undefined
- The label accurately describes what is being displayed
